# Random Server
This is a simple minestom server that transfers the player to a random server in the [servers.json](servers.json) file.

## Adding a Server
Any user is welcome to add their server to the list. To do this, either create an [issue](https://github.com/tarna/random-server/issues) with the request or create a PR with your server added to [servers.json](servers.json).

The format for the server is as follows:
```json
{
  "name": "Server Name",
  "address": "server.address.com",
  "port": 25565
}
```

## Showcase
You can find the publicly hosted version at `random.tarna.dev`.
